### Add a Role

1. Access site roles by going to Menu > Administration then the Roles Tab
1. Click the **add** button
1. Give the role a name, description and check any permissions it should have.

## AppBuilder Roles

AppBuilder roles can be used with the Access Page Manager to set fine grained access permissions down to any page or tab. They can also be assigned Scopes which limit the data the user can see.

User with an AppBuilder Role will still need a Site Role that gives them access to the module.

### Add Roles

1. In AppBuilder go to the Administration Page
