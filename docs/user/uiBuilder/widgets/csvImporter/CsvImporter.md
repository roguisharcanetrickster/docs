This widget will display a button that opens a CSV Import tool. In the CSV import tool allows users to select a CSV file to upload the rows and save them as records of the configured object. The users can configure how each column of the csv maps to the fields of the object.

## Properties

### Data

**Data Source** - choose a data collection from the drop down list. This is where the uploaded CSV will save to.

### Rules

**Record Rules** - select settings then add, to add a [record rule](../../../concepts/recordRules/RecordRules.md). This rule will be applied to each record imported.

### Customize display

**Label** - this is the text displayed on the button.

**Width** - change the width of the button. With width set to 0 the button will be automatically scaled.
