title: CSV Exporter

This widget will display a button that creates a CSV file based on the Data Collection it is configured with.

## Properties

### Data

**Data Source** - choose a data collection from the drop down list. The data collection does _not_ require the load all setting.

**Header on First Row** - with this selected the field names will be added to the first row of the CSV, otherwise only the data values will be in the CSV

**Filter Option** - add a [filter](../../../concepts/filters/Filters.md) to limit the data included in the exported CSV file.

### Customize display

**Label** - this is the text displayed on the button.

**File name** - the file name for the exported csv

**Width** - change the width of the button. With width set to 0 the button will be automatically scaled.
