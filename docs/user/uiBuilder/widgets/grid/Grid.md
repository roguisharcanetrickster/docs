**User can delete records** - Displays a delete icon next to each record, allowing user to delete records. The deleted records will be permanently removed, so think through whether this setting is needed.

**User can sort records** - Displays an **Apply Sort** button above the grid. User can click to sort by the fields they choose.

**User can export** - Displays an **Export** Button above the grid. Users can download the grid contents as CSV, Excel, PDF or PNG.\
_Note: Only the loaded data will be exported. By default this is the first 30 records. Using the load all option on your data collection will allow user to export the full data set; however, load all on large data set will slow down page loading. For large data exports use the [CSV Exporter](../csvExporter/CsvExporter.md)._

### Grid Data

Records can be grouped by a common field. A summary line of the group will show the total for number fields and count for other fields. User can click to expand the group and see each record as they normally would.

After adding the fields drag and drop in the space below to reorder the grouping hierarchy.
