Filters can be used in many places within AppBuider to narrow down a set of records. A filter rule looks like this:
![](./images/filters.png)

1. **And/Or:** 'And' or 'Or' is used when you have multiple filter rules, to determine how to apply the rules. If all the rules should be true then select AND if only one of the rules needs to be true then select OR
1. **Field:** This is the Object Field to use in the filter.
1. **Operation:** This is the type of operation to be used for filtering. A default choice will be made based on the field type. See Operations Below
1. **Value:** The value used depends on the Operation, sometimes it is text, number, date or a selection. In certain cases no value is needed
1. **Add Another Rule**
1. **Delete the Rule**
