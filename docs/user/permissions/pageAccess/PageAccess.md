Page access can be handled in two ways in AppBuilder. By default a module is visible to any [site role](../roles/Roles.md#site-roles) that has been given access. If more fine grained control is needed the
[Access Management Page (AMP)](#access-management-page) can be used to assign access to specific sub pages and tabs based on [AppBuilder roles](../roles/Roles.md#appbuilder-roles).

## Grant Access to an Entire App/Root Page

1. From AppBuilder select the cog beside the module and choose setting
