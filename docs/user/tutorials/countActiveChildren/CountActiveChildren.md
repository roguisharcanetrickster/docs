description: Example using formula field to get key metrics

When you open an App its always nice to see a few metrics that summarize the current situation.

## Goal

In Education Matters we want to show the metric 'Active Children'. This should be the number of children in the system with the `Status` set to `Active`.

### Prerequisites

- An Object called Children with at least these fields:

  | Field  | Type                                      |
  | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
  | Name   | Text                                      |
  | Status | Select List (Options: Active, Not Active) |

- A form to add a Child record

## Step One: Create an Entity Object

First we need to add a new object to represent the entire system.

We can call it `Entity` and add a `Name` text field.

We also need to create a connected record field called `Children` with a connection to the Children object. The rule should be 1 Entity connects Multiple Children.

Now that Entity has Children connected we can use the Formula Field Type to count them. However, the Formula field needs to reference a number field on the connected record. Our Children Object does not have a valid number field, so we can add a number field called `To Count`.

Back on the Entity, we'll add the field `Active Children` with the field type Formula. Change the `Type` to `Count` and select the `Field` as `Children -> To Count`.

{% include notification.html dismissable="true" status="is-info" message="In this case the actual value of the `To Count` is not important. Count will be the same if the values are 0 or any other value. For the other formula field operations (average, sum, min, max) it's important to consider the values." %}

Lastly we need to add a filter to the formula field. We'll use `Status` `equals` `Active` so that only children with the Active status show in our count.

## Step Two: Set up your Entity

Now that the object is ready let's add an Entity Record with the Name `Education Matters`.

Next we need to make sure that all Children get added to the Education Matters Entity. To do this we can add a [Record Rule](../../concepts/recordRules/RecordRules.md) to the Add Child Form. This will assign new children to the Education Matters Entity.

To create the record rule we need a Data Collection for our Entity. Because we only have 1 entity we can set [Select] to [First Record].

Now we can go into our form and add the record rule. Let's choose `update record` as the `Action` and then Set `Entity` to our Entity Data Collection with the current selection.

{% include notification.html dismissable="true" status="is-info" message="If you have multiple forms to add Children you will need to add record rules to each." %}

## Conclusion

We now have everything set up for the Active Children Count. It will increase as more children are added or when the Child's status is changed.
